Rules of life:


    - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

    - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

    - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

    - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
